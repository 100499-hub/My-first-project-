# My-first-project-

This was my first project in
C++ is a code that displays 2 clocks, one in 12hrs format and the other in 24hrs format, making the classes I think was the easiest part of the program, 
understanding what the public and private data were was a bit difficult for me and also the main with the menu, when I had a problem and didn't know how to continue, 
I searched web pages like stackoverflow to find a solution and continue with the project, it's an easy project but for me, in a new language with a new IDE it was complicated, 
the help of comments and good space between lines helped me to keep the code in order and readable, understanding the use of classes in this project would be key to be able to do future projects.
